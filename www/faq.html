	<h4><a name="1.1">1.1 - What are the main benefits of the Looks?</a></h4>

	<p>
	The JGoodies Looks improve the readability, legibility, consistency and 
	in turn the usability of your Java applications and applets. 
	They simplify the support for multiple platforms by using similar
	component sizes in the different JGoodies Look&amp;Feels.
	Hence, switching the Look&amp;Feel doesn't change the size
	of your forms and editors.
	Also, the JGoodies Looks bring bug fixes from recent Java runtimes
	to older Java versions.
	And last but not least, many people have reviewed the
	JGoodies L&amp;Fs as elegant.


	<h4><a name="1.2">1.2 - Can I use the Looks in a commercial product?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can use, copy and redistribute the JGoodies Looks in source and binary form
	- even for commercial use - if you comply with the very relaxed terms 
	of the <a href="../LICENSE.txt">BSD open source license</a>.
	The BSD license has been chosen, because it allows many uses,
	and the few license terms are short and human readable, 
	even if you're not a lawyer.



	<h4><a name="1.3">1.3 - Where do I get support?</a></h4>

    <p>
	Support is available only in the user mailing list
	<a href="mailto:users@looks.dev.java.net">users@looks.dev.java.net</a>.
	Before you post check this FAQ, the relevant JavaDocs,
	the User's Guide, and the accompanying demo sources.
	Please
	<a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">register</a> 
    with the user mailing list before you post. 
    Otherwise I need to manually accept your message.
        
	<p>
    You can find and track the progress of Looks issues in the 
	<a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>. 
	As a project observer you can log defects, request features and suggest enhancements.
	
	<p>
	Priority support is available for commercial licensees of the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/products/swingsuite.html">JGoodies Swing Suite</a>. 
	These can contact us by phone or direct questions to support at JGoodies dot com.
		
	<p>
	If you have general questions related to Java look&amp;feels
	you better post them to the Java desktop forums at www.java.net.
	That's a great place to share information with the Java desktop community.
	And we frequently check this forum and participate in discussions.	
		

	<h4><a name="1.4">1.4 - How to report a problem?</a></h4>
		
	Before you report a problem check this FAQ and check if the problem 
	is in the Java core or in the JGoodies Looks. Basically bugs in 
	the Java core shall be reported to Sun, issues with the JGoodies
	to the JGoodies project.
	
	<p>
	We generally don't accept bugs that are in the Java core.
	There are many issues with the Sun L&amp;fs and there are
	even more issues if you take different Java runtimes into account.
	Most of the Java core issues are inherited by the JGoodies L&amp;fs.
	But we can't do more than Sun's Swing team does for a single Java version.
	So if you can reproduce a Plastic issue with Sun's Metal L&amp;F, 
	then report it to Sun. 
	If you can reproduce a JGoodies Windows issue with Sun's Windows L&amp;F
	report it to Sun.
	
	<p>
	If you think you've found a bug in the JGoodies Looks 
	and again, only in the JGoodies Looks, you may check back
	in the issue tracker or may ask in the user mailing list, 
	if this issue is already know.
	
	<p>
	If you report a bug, please provide at least the following information:
	JRE vendor, JRE version, JRE build, OS, OS version, Looks version,
	Look&amp;feel used, and if the problem can be reproduced with the
	JGoodies Looks Demo.
	For example: <em>Sun Java 1.5.0_06, Windows XP, Looks 2.0, PlasticXP,
	can be reproduced with the JGoodies Looks Demo</em>. 
	If you cannot reproduce the problem with the Looks Demo,
	a screenshot can often help to quickly point us to the problem.

		<h4><a name="2.3">2.3 - How to remove the JTabbedPane content border?</a></h4>

		<h4><a name="3.1">3.1 ClassNotFoundExceptions when launched with Java Web Start</a></h4>

		<p>
	If you use a third party l&amp;f in a network launchable environment
	such as Java Web Start, you must indicate where to find the l&amp;f classes:
<pre>
   UIManager.put("ClassLoader", LookUtils.class.getClassLoader());
</pre>


		<h4><a name="3.2">3.2 The Plastic color theme I set is ignored.</a></h4>

		<p>
	 To make use of a Plastic color theme, you must set the theme
	 <em>before</em> you set the Plastic look&amp;feel in the UIManager.
	 <a href="guide/lookandtheme.html">More...</a>


		<h4><a name="3.3">3.3 - Why not put the Looks JAR into the extension directory?</a></h4>
		
		<p>
		First off, this issue is not specific to the JGoodies Looks,
		it affects all Java libraries.

		<p>
		If you have full control over the applications running 
		in a Java environment, you can put a single library version 
		per library into the extension path.
		If you have no control over the applications running
		in your Java environment, use the user classpath only!
		   Many runtime environments out there are shared by
		multiple applications, and so one has no control over
		the classes loaded or required by these applications.
		In this case, do not put a library version into
		the extension classpath. 
		
		<p>
		Here's the problem:
		let's say you have a library class <tt>C</tt> with method <tt>C#m1</tt>.
		In a second version of the same class (<tt>C</tt>') you add <tt>#m2</tt>.
		If you put C into the extension path,
		and have an application that includes <tt>C</tt>' in its JAR,
		the app will load <tt>C</tt>, not <tt>C</tt>'. And the application may fail
		with a <tt>NoSuchMethodException</tt> or other exception.
		    If the implementation of <tt>#m1</tt> differs in <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C</tt>',
		the application will load C and execute <tt>C#m1</tt> and
		won't benefit from changes to <tt>#m1</tt>.
		
		<p>
		Even if you <em>can</em> use the extension directory,
		you may consider extending the user classpath,
		for example by referencing all required libraries
		in a main JAR's manifest. Using the user classpath
		makes it simpler to move an application to other
		Java environments that you don't control, for example
		to provide a Web start version.
