	<h4><a name="benefits">What are the main benefits of the Looks?</a></h4>

	<p>
	The JGoodies Looks improve the readability, legibility, consistency and 
	in turn the usability of your Java applications and applets. 
	And many people have reviewed the JGoodies L&amp;Fs as elegant.
	Also, the JGoodies Looks bring bug fixes from recent Java versions
	to older Java versions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The JGoodies Windows Look&amp;Feel focuses on a precise emulation
	on Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/2003/XP/Vista in the following areas: 
	menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	It honors the screen resolution (96dpi vs. 120 dpi) 
	to adjust sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	And it honors the desktop font size setting in western Windows environments.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Plastic, Plastic3D, and PlasticXP are elegant multi-platform Look&amp;Feels
	that look good on all Windows platforms, including XP.
	The Plastic themes have been tweaked for a harmonic integration 
	with the majority of desktops so that your applications
	won't alienate a Windows user.	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The JGoodies Looks simplify the support for different Java versions,
	operating systems, and Look&amp;Feels.
	Each look is consistent over the Java versions 1.4.1x, 1.4.2x, 1.5,
	and 1.6 betas - to the possible extent w. r. t. to the underlying 
	Swing implementation. 
	And all JGoodies L&amp;Fs use similar component sizes 
	to minimize the layout differences when switching the Look&amp;Feel.
	</p>




	<h4><a name="commercialUse">Can I use the Looks in a commercial product?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can use, copy and redistribute the JGoodies Looks in source and binary form
	- even for commercial use - if you comply with the very relaxed terms 
	of the <a href="../LICENSE.txt">BSD open source license</a>.
	The BSD license has been chosen, because it allows many uses,
	and the few license terms are short and human readable, 
	even if you're not a lawyer.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="howToGetStarted">How to get started?</a></h4>
	<p>
	First, open and read the README.html and learn about the available documentation:
	the <em>RELEASE-NOTES</em>, <em>Quick Start</em>, <em>User's Guide</em>, 
	<em>Tips &amp; Tricks</em>, <em>JavaDocs</em>.
	Then download and run the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/looksdemo/index.html">JGoodies Looks Demo</a>.
	Follow the instructions in the User's Guide how to use a JGoodies Look&amp;Feel,
	how to configure it, and how to use the optional features.
	You may also study the presentation "First Aid for Swing" at
	the <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/">JGoodies articles</a> page.
	</p>

	


	<h4><a name="support">Where do I get support?</a></h4>

    <p>
	Support is available only in the user mailing list
	<a href="mailto:users@looks.java.net">users@looks.java.net</a>.
	Before you post, check this FAQ, the relevant JavaDocs,
	the User's Guide (available from the README.html), 
	and the accompanying demo sources.
    You can find and track the progress of Looks issues in the 
	<a href="https://looks.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>. 
	As a project observer you can log defects, request features and suggest enhancements.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The user mailing list helps us reduce the costs for managing 
	this freeware project. In the mailing list all project users
	can jump in to assist you, if you face a problem with the library or API. 
	And other users can benefit from your questions and our answers.
	Personal mail to JGoodies.com bypasses the other project developers,
	and it often leads to unnecessary extra work; it slows down
	the development process, and it costs time and money on our side.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you have downloaded the library at no charge,
	I ask you to 
	<a href="https://looks.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">register</a> 
    with the user mailing list before you post, and post only with the 
    registered account.
    Otherwise your messages won't show up automatically, 
    and I need to manually accept every message.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Priority support is available for licensees of the commercial 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/products">JGoodies Smart Client</a>. 
	These can contact us by phone or direct questions to support at JGoodies dot com.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	If you have general questions about Swing and Java look&amp;feels,
	please post to the Java Desktop forums at www.java.net.
	That's a great place to share information with the Java desktop community.
	And we frequently check this forum and participate in discussions.	
	</p>
		

	<h4><a name="howToReportAProblem">How to report a problem?</a></h4>
	<p>
	Before you report a problem, check this FAQ, the relevant JavaDocs,
	the User's Guide (available from the README.html), 
	and the accompanying demo sources.
	Important: please check if the problem is in the Java core 
	or in the JGoodies Looks. Basically bugs in the Java core 
	shall be reported to Sun, bugs in the JGoodies to the JGoodies project.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We don't accept reports for bugs that are in the Java core.
	There are many issues with the Sun L&amp;fs in each individual Java version.
	And there are even more issues in all Java versions that run the JGoodies Looks.
	But we can't do more than Sun's Swing team does for a single Java version.
	Most of the Java core issues "shine through" to the JGoodies L&amp;fs.
	So if you can reproduce a Plastic issue with Sun's Metal L&amp;F, 
	then report it to Sun. 
	If you can reproduce a JGoodies Windows issue with Sun's Windows L&amp;F,
	report it to Sun.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you think you've found a bug in the JGoodies Looks, 
	and again, not in the Java core but in the JGoodies Looks, 
	you may check back in the issue tracker or 
	may ask in the user mailing list, 
	if this issue is already known.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you report a bug, please provide at least the following information:
	JRE vendor, JRE version, JRE build, OS, OS version, Looks version,
	Look&amp;feel used, and whether the problem can be reproduced with the
	JGoodies Looks Demo or not.
	For example: <em>Sun Java 1.5.0_06, Windows XP, Looks 2.0, PlasticXP,
	can be reproduced with the JGoodies Looks Demo</em>. 
	Please point us to the Looks Demo, if it shows a problem.
	If you cannot reproduce the problem with the Looks Demo,
	please describe the steps to produce the problem.
	Often a screenshot makes it easier to understand a problem,
	or a request for an enhancement.

	<h4><a name="differencesSun">What are the differences between the Sun and JGoodies Windows L&amp;Fs?</a></h4>
	<p>
	The JGoodies Looks 2.0.1 uses more consistent fonts, font baseline positions,
	component sizes, and insets than the Sun Windows L&amp;f.
	On western Windows the JGoodies Windows L&amp;f honors 
	the desktop font size setting <em>Normal/Large/Extra Large</em>.
	And the JGoodies Looks brings bug fixes from recent Java versions
	to older Java versions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Sun Windows L&amp;F provides a better live update 
	of colors and fonts. If the user changes the desktop settings
	these changes shall be reflected in Swing immediately.
	This works well with the Sun Windows L&amp;f.
	The color and fonts corrected by the JGoodies Windows L&amp;f
	may change immediately or may require an application restart.
	Also, the JGoodies Windows L&amp;F may lag slightly behind
	the most recent Sun Windows L&amp;F bug fixes. This is because 
	the Sun or JGoodies code may include a bug fix earlier than the other. 
	Most Sun bug fixes are inherited by the JGoodies implementation, 
	but not every fix. For example when Sun introduced subpixel anti-aliasing 
	in an early Java 6 preview, the JGoodies implementation supported 
	this feature with a delay of 2 months. But we always try to catch up 
	with the core <em>before</em> a new major Java version is available.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We are interested in moving the fixes and changes made in the JGoodies
	Looks to the Java core. This is the best way to help the Swing community
	get a great Windows appearance. We were invited to join the Mustang effort 
	lately. But more JGoodies improvements shall be moved to the Java 7 core.
	Hopefully this will include the consistent micro design.
	A proposal for an approach to move this to the core is tracked
	under <a href="https://looks.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=116">issue #116</a>.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="differencesWinLAF">What are the differences between WinLAF and the JGoodies Windows L&amp;F?</a></h4>
	<p>
	As of the Looks 2.0 and WinLAF 0.5.1, the JGoodies Windows l&amp;f 
	provides a more precise micro design for 96dpi and 120dpi which 
	leads to better readability and legibility, especially if used with a
	precise layout system such as 
	the <a href="http://forms.java.net/">JGoodies Forms</a>.
	The JGoodies Windows l&amp;f uses consistent component sizes and insets,
	and it follows the "Windows Layout Specifications and Guidelines"
	and the "Windows Vista UX Guidelines" 0.8.
	Unlike WinLAF, the JGoodies L&amp;f can be uninstalled properly at runtime
	enabling a hot L&amp;f switch.
	Last but not least, the Looks 2.0 support Java 6 and Windows Vista.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Currently both the winlaf and JGoodies l&amp;f fix bugs in the 
	Sun Windows l&amp;f that are not addressed by the other project.
	In 2005 WinLAF and JGoodies started to join their efforts in making 
	the Windows look&amp;feel look and feel like Windows.
	Several fixes could be moved to the Sun Windows l&amp;f in Java 6.

	<h4><a name="3.1">ClassNotFoundExceptions when launched with Java Web Start</a></h4>
	<p>
	If you use a third party l&amp;f in a network launchable environment
	such as Java Web Start, you must indicate where to find the l&amp;f classes:
	</p>
<pre>
UIManager.put(
    "ClassLoader", 
    LookUtils.class.getClassLoader());
</pre>



	<h4><a name="3.2">The Plastic color theme I set is ignored.</a></h4>
	<p>
	To make use of a Plastic color theme, you must set the theme
	<em>before</em> you set the Plastic look&amp;feel in the UIManager.
	See also the section "Look &amp; Theme" in the Looks' User's Guide.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="3.3">Why not put the Looks JAR into the extension directory?</a></h4>
	<p>
	First off, this issue is not specific to the JGoodies Looks,
	it affects all Java libraries.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you have full control over the applications running 
	in a Java environment, you can put a single library version 
	per library into the extension path.
	If you have no control over the applications running
	in your Java environment, use the user classpath only!
	   Many runtime environments out there are shared by
	multiple applications, and so one has no control over
	the classes loaded or required by these applications.
	In this case, do not put a library version into
	the extension classpath. 
	</p>
		
	<p>
	Here's the problem:
	let's say you have a library class <tt>C</tt> with method <tt>C#m1</tt>.
	In a second version of the same class (<tt>C</tt>') you add <tt>#m2</tt>.
	If you put C into the extension path,
	and have an application that includes <tt>C</tt>' in its JAR,
	the app will load <tt>C</tt>, not <tt>C</tt>'. And the application may fail
	with a <tt>NoSuchMethodException</tt> or other exception.
	    If the implementation of <tt>#m1</tt> differs in <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C</tt>',
	the application will load C and execute <tt>C#m1</tt> and
	won't benefit from changes to <tt>#m1</tt>.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	Even if you <em>can</em> use the extension directory,
	you may consider extending the user classpath,
	for example by referencing all required libraries
	in a main JAR's manifest. Using the user classpath
	makes it simpler to move an application to other
	Java environments that you don't control, for example
	to provide a Web start version.
