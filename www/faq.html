	    <b>Do&nbsp;not send personal mail!</b>
	    In your mail please provide the following information:
	    Java vendor, Java version, Java build, OS, OS version, 
	    Looks version, the L&amp;F used. For example:
	    Sun J2SE 1.4.2_03, Windows 2000, Looks 1.2.1, PlasticXP.

		<p>
		For defects, features and enhancements use the
	    <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>.
	    Before you enter a defect, please make sure that the problem
	    appears with the Looks only, not the underlying Java core look&amp;feels.
	    Try to reproduce Plastic defects with the Metal L&amp;f
	    and defects in the JGoodies Windows L&amp;f
	    with the default Windows L&amp;f.
		
		
		<h2><a name="1.7">1.7 - Why not put the Looks JAR into the extension directory?</a></h2>
		
		<p>
		First off, this issue is not specific to the JGoodies Looks,
		it affects all Java libraries.

		<p>
		If you have full control over the applications running 
		in a Java environment, you can put a single library version 
		per library into the extension path.
		If you have no control over the applications running
		in your Java environment, use the user classpath only!
		   Many runtime environments out there are shared by
		multiple applications, and so one has no control over
		the classes loaded or required by these applications.
		In this case, do not put a library version into
		the extension classpath. 
		
		<p>
		Here's the problem:
		let's say you have a library class <tt>C</tt> with method <tt>C#m1</tt>.
		In a second version of the same class (<tt>C</tt>') you add <tt>#m2</tt>.
		If you put C into the extension path,
		and have an application that includes <tt>C</tt>' in its JAR,
		the app will load <tt>C</tt>, not <tt>C</tt>'. And the application may fail
		with a <tt>NoSuchMethodException</tt> or other exception.
		    If the implementation of <tt>#m1</tt> differs in <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C</tt>',
		the application will load C and execute <tt>C#m1</tt> and
		won't benefit from changes to <tt>#m1</tt>.
		
		<p>
		Even if you <em>can</em> use the extension directory,
		you may consider extending the user classpath,
		for example by referencing all required libraries
		in a main JAR's manifest. Using the user classpath
		makes it simpler to move an application to other
		Java environments that you don't control, for example
		to provide a Web start version.

	<h1>3. Trouble Shooting</h2>
	

		<h2><a name="3.1">3.1 ClassNotFoundExceptions when launched with Java Web Start</a></h2>

		<p>
	If you use a third party l&amp;f in a network launchable environment
	such as Java Web Start, you must indicate where to find the l&amp;f classes:
<pre>
   UIManager.put("ClassLoader", LookUtils.class.getClassLoader());
</pre>


		<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 The Plastic color theme I set is ignored.</a></h2>

		<p>
	 To make use of a Plastic color theme, you must set the theme
	 <em>before</em> you set the Plastic look&amp;feel in the UIManager.
