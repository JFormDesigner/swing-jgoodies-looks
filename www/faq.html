		<h4><a name="1.1">1.1 - What are the main benefits of the Looks?</a></h4>

		<p>
		The JGoodies Looks improve the readability, legibility, consistency and 
		in turn the usability of your Java applications and applets. 
		They simplify the support for multiple platforms by using similar
		component sizes in the different JGoodies Look&amp;Feels.
		Hence, switching the Look&amp;Feel doesn't change the size
		of your forms and editors.
		Also, the JGoodies Looks bring bug fixes from recent Java runtimes
		to older Java versions.
		And last but not least, many people have reviewed the
		JGoodies L&amp;Fs as elegant.


		<h4><a name="1.2">1.2 - Where do I get support?</a></h4>

        with this list before you post; otherwise I need to manually accept your messages.
	    
        Also, you can use the 
        <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>
        to find issues regarding the Looks. As a project observer you can log defects, 
        request features and suggest enhancements.

		<p>
		Priority support is available for commercial licensees of the 
		<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/products/swingsuite.html">JGoodies Swing Suite</a>.

		<h4><a name="1.3">1.3 - How to report a problem?</a></h4>
		
		<p>
		In case of a general problem, first 
		<a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=users&by=subject">browse</a>
		or 
		<a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/SearchList?listName=users&by=subject">search</a>
		the user mailing list archive.
		If&nbsp;you can't find anything useful, direct questions to 
		<a href="mailto:users@looks.dev.java.net">users@looks.dev.java.net</a>.
	    <b>Do&nbsp;not send personal mail!</b>
	    In your mail please provide the following information:
	    Java vendor, Java version, Java build, OS, OS version, 
	    Looks version, the L&amp;F used. For example:
	    Sun J2SE 1.4.2_03, Windows 2000, Looks 1.2.1, PlasticXP.

		<p>
		For defects, features and enhancements use the
	    <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>.
	    Before you enter a defect, please make sure that the problem
	    appears with the Looks only, not the underlying Java core look&amp;feels.
	    Try to reproduce Plastic defects with the Metal L&amp;f
	    and defects in the JGoodies Windows L&amp;f
	    with the default Windows L&amp;f.
		
		
		<h4><a name="1.4">1.4 - Can I use the Looks in a commercial product?</a></h4>

		<p>
		You can use and redistribute the JGoodies Looks in source and binary form
		- even for commercial use - if you comply with the very relaxed terms 
		of the <a href="../LICENSE.txt">BSD open source license</a>.
		The BSD license has been chosen, because it allows many uses,
		and the few license terms are short and human readable, 
		even if you're not a lawyer.



	
		<h4><a name="2.1">2.1 - How to use a JGoodies Look&amp;Feel?</a></h4>

<pre>
   try {
      UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new PlasticXPLookAndFeel());
   } catch (Exception e) {}
</pre>
See also the section "Look &amp; Theme" in the Looks' User's Guide.

		<h4><a name="2.3">2.3 - How to remove the JTabbedPane content border?</a></h4>

</pre>

		
		

		<h4><a name="3.1">3.1 ClassNotFoundExceptions when launched with Java Web Start</a></h4>

		<p>
	If you use a third party l&amp;f in a network launchable environment
	such as Java Web Start, you must indicate where to find the l&amp;f classes:
<pre>
   UIManager.put("ClassLoader", LookUtils.class.getClassLoader());
</pre>


		<h4><a name="3.2">3.2 The Plastic color theme I set is ignored.</a></h4>

		<p>
	 To make use of a Plastic color theme, you must set the theme
	 <em>before</em> you set the Plastic look&amp;feel in the UIManager.
	 <a href="guide/lookandtheme.html">More...</a>


		<h4><a name="3.3">3.3 - Why not put the Looks JAR into the extension directory?</a></h4>
		
		<p>
		First off, this issue is not specific to the JGoodies Looks,
		it affects all Java libraries.

		<p>
		If you have full control over the applications running 
		in a Java environment, you can put a single library version 
		per library into the extension path.
		If you have no control over the applications running
		in your Java environment, use the user classpath only!
		   Many runtime environments out there are shared by
		multiple applications, and so one has no control over
		the classes loaded or required by these applications.
		In this case, do not put a library version into
		the extension classpath. 
		
		<p>
		Here's the problem:
		let's say you have a library class <tt>C</tt> with method <tt>C#m1</tt>.
		In a second version of the same class (<tt>C</tt>') you add <tt>#m2</tt>.
		If you put C into the extension path,
		and have an application that includes <tt>C</tt>' in its JAR,
		the app will load <tt>C</tt>, not <tt>C</tt>'. And the application may fail
		with a <tt>NoSuchMethodException</tt> or other exception.
		    If the implementation of <tt>#m1</tt> differs in <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C</tt>',
		the application will load C and execute <tt>C#m1</tt> and
		won't benefit from changes to <tt>#m1</tt>.
		
		<p>
		Even if you <em>can</em> use the extension directory,
		you may consider extending the user classpath,
		for example by referencing all required libraries
		in a main JAR's manifest. Using the user classpath
		makes it simpler to move an application to other
		Java environments that you don't control, for example
		to provide a Web start version.
