	<i>Free High-Fidelity Windows and Multi-Platform Appearance</i>
  
	<p>
	The JGoodies look&amp;feels make your Swing applications and applets look better. 
	They have been optimized for readability, precise micro-design and usability. 
    And they simplify the multi-platform support by using
	similar widget dimensions.
	Anyway, many people have reviewed them as elegant.

	<p>
	Before you enter a bug report, please make sure that the problem appears 
	with the JGoodies L&amp;f only,	not with the parent Sun L&amp;f 
	(Plastic -> Metal, JGoodies Windows -> Sun Windows).
	If you have found a bug, please provide the following information:
	JRE vendor, JRE version, JRE build, OS, OS version, Looks version,
	Look&amp;feel used. For example: Sun J2SE 1.4.2_05, Windows 2000,
	Looks 1.3, PlasticXP.


    <h3>Features</h3>
 
	<p><strong>JGoodies Windows L&amp;F :: Precise Emulation</strong><br>

	The JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel focuses on a precise emulation
	on Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000 in the following areas: 
	menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	It honors the screen resolution (96dpi vs. 120 dpi)
	to adjust sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	The Windows XP emulation still lags behind the classic emulation,
	nevertheless it has been improved significantly in the Looks version 1.2.


    <p><strong>High-Fidelity Multi Platform Appearance</strong><br>

	Plastic is an elegant multi-platform look&amp;feel family that works very well 
	on all Windows platforms, including XP.
	The Plastic themes have been tweaked for a harmonic integration 
	with the majority of desktops so that your applications
	won't alienate a Windows user.


	<p><strong>Simplifying Multi Platform Support</strong><br>

	The looks help you support different Java versions and operating systems.
	Each look is consistent over the Java versions 1.4.0x, 1.4.1x, 1.4.2x,
	and 1.5 - to the possible extent w. r. t. to features of the underlying Swing API.

	<p>In addition, Plastic, the JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel, and the Mac OS X Aqua look
	use similar widget dimensions and widget font baselines to minimize layout 
	differences between these looks.


	<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>
		
	<p>
	The Looks library ensures the visual quality of the 
	JGoodies freeware <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/index.html">tools and demos</a> 
	- see yourself.
