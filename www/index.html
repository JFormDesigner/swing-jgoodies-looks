	<i>Free High-Fidelity Windows and Multi-Platform Appearance</i>
  
	<p>
	The JGoodies look&amp;feels make your Swing applications and applets look better. 
	They have been optimized for readability, precise micro-design and usability. 
    And they simplify the multi-platform support by using
	similar widget dimensions.
	Anyway, many people have reviewed them as elegant.

    <h3>Features</h3>
 
	<p><strong>JGoodies Windows L&amp;F :: Precise Emulation</strong><br>

	The JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel focuses on a precise emulation
	on Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000 in the following areas: 
	menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	It honors the screen resolution (96dpi vs. 120 dpi)
	to adjust sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	The Windows XP emulation still lags behind the classic emulation,
	nevertheless it has been improved significantly in the Looks version 1.2.


    <p><strong>High-Fidelity Multi Platform Appearance</strong><br>

	Plastic is an elegant multi-platform look&amp;feel family that works very well 
	on all Windows platforms, including XP.
	The Plastic themes have been tweaked for a harmonic integration 
	with the majority of desktops so that your applications
	won't alienate a Windows user.


	<p><strong>Simplifying Multi Platform Support</strong><br>

	The looks help you support different Java versions and operating systems.
	Each look is consistent over the Java versions 1.4.0x, 1.4.1x, 1.4.2x,
	and 1.5 betas - to the possible extent w. r. t. to features of the underlying Swing API.

	<p>In addition, Plastic, the JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel, and the Mac OS X native look
	use similar widget dimensions and widget font baselines to minimize layout 
	differences between these looks.


	<p><strong>ClearLook&trade; :: Find and Fix Common Swing Misuse</strong><br>

	The ClearLook technology is an add-on to the JGoodies Looks
	that can automatically correct critical and typical Swing misuse.
	The ClearLook algorithm performs basic steps to polish
	your Swing UI.

	<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
	
	<p>
	The finished library you can now download for free has been financed 
	by sponsors of my Java desktop activities and customers of my products. 
	It is only with their money that I could open source and provide it at no charge. 
	
	<p>
	Many thanks to all these customers and sponsors, 
	especially the Java desktop team at Sun Microsystems.
