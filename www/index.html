    <h3>Features</h3>
 
	<p><strong>JGoodies Windows L&amp;F :: Precise Emulation</strong><br>

	The JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel focuses on a precise emulation
	on Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/2003/XP in the following areas: 
	menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
	It honors the screen resolution (96dpi vs. 120 dpi) 
	to adjust sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.


    <p><strong>High-Fidelity Multi Platform Appearance</strong><br>

	Plastic is an elegant multi-platform look&amp;feel family that works very well 
	on all Windows platforms, including XP.
	The Plastic themes have been tweaked for a harmonic integration 
	with the majority of desktops so that your applications
	won't alienate a Windows user.


	<p><strong>Simplifying Multi Platform Support</strong><br>

	The Looks help you support different Java versions and operating systems.
	Each look is consistent over the Java versions 1.4.1x, 1.4.2x, 1.5,
	and 1.6 betas - to the possible extent w. r. t. to features of the underlying Swing API.

	<p>In addition, Plastic, the JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel, and the Mac OS X Aqua look
	use similar widget dimensions and widget font baselines to minimize layout 
	differences between these looks.
