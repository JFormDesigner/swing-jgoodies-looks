BEFORE YOU CAN START                       

     The JGoodies l&fs must be contained in your Java classpath. 
     If you want all l&fs, add 'looks-x.x.x.jar' to your classpath; 
     if you want to the Plastic l&fs only, include 'plastic-x.x.x.jar'; 
     if you need only the Windows l&f, include 'looks-win-x.x.x.jar'.
     As an alternative, you can extract the files from the JAR for 
     inclusion in one of your application JARs or classpath entries,
     or import the sources.
     

USING A JGOODIES LOOK&FEEL

     This JGoodies Looks distribution provides four different looks:
       1) JGoodies Windows Look&Feel
          com.jgoodies.plaf.windows.ExtWindowsLookAndFeel
       2) JGoodies Plastic Look&Feel
          com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.PlasticLookAndFeel
       3) JGoodies Plastic3D Look&Feel
          com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.Plastic3DLookAndFeel
       4) JGoodies PlasticXP Look&Feel
          com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.PlasticXPLookAndFeel

     To use these looks, set it in the UIManager, by reference or by name:
       1) UIManager.setLookAndFeel(
             new com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.Plastic3DLookAndFeel());
       2) UIManager.setLookAndFeel("com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.Plastic3DLookAndFeel");
	   		
     Plastic and Plastic3D support color themes, much like 
     Sun's Java Look&Feel; you can set a color theme, for example:
		  Plastic3DLookAndFeel.setMyCurrentTheme(
		      new com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.theme.ExperienceBlue());
	 Note: To make use of the new color theme, you must set the look&feel 
	 in the UIManager as described above, after you set the theme.
     Find predefined color themes in package com.jgoodies.plaf.plastic.theme.
     
     

DEVELOPER REFERENCE

     The JGoodies L&fs introduce several optional L&f properties 
     and JComponent client properties that enable you to tweak your 
     application's visual appearance. You can find keys and/or accessors 
     to this optional behavior in class com.jgoodies.plaf.Options. 
     
     See the integrated help in JGoodies Looks Demo for a code reference.



EXAMPLES
   
     JGoodies Looks comes with two examples: Tiny, and Looks Demo;
     the JGoodies Looks Pro adds the Skeleton application.
     
     Tiny is a minimal Swing application, that demos, how to install
     and use a JGoodies look&feel in a Swing application.
     
     The Looks Demo demos the optional settings of the JGoodies l&fs.
     You can  look at the sources, but you cannot compile them;
     this is, because this demo utilizes the JGoodies Swing Suite
     that is not included in the Looks packages.
     
     Skeleton is a small Swing demo application that can help you
     get started with Swing and that uses and demos the JGoodies l&fs.
     See file 'readme.txt' in the Skeleton example directory.
