<h4>Look &amp; Feel</h4>

You can choose a look&amp;feel from the list of available looks,
so that you can compare the appearance of different looks.

<br><h4>Theme</h4>

If you have selected the JGoodies Plastic or Plastic3D look,
you can select a theme from the list.

<br><h4>System Fonts</h4>

You can specify, whether the look&amp;feel shall use
the fonts used by the operating system. 


In 1.4 environments, this will work for all JGoodies looks, 
Sun Metal, and Sun Windows.
In 1.3 Windows environments, the JGoodies looks 
use a good guess for the system font; 
this should work fine for the majority of desktop settings 
on Windows 98/NT/2000/ME and with some restrictions on Windows 95 and XP.
