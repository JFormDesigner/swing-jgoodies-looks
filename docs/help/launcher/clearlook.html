ClearLook is an add-on to the JGoodies looks. 
It can automatically correct the most critical 
and typical Swing misuse.

Check the <a href="../reference/clearlook.html">reference</a> for details.


<br><h4>ClearLook Mode</h4>

By default, ClearLook is switched off.
You can switch it <i>on</i>, enable a <i>verbose mode</i>,
or use it in <i>debug mode</i>.

The verbose mode logs reports about the ClearLook analysis
and modifications to the console.
In debug mode, ClearLook marks decorations that
it considers as being visual clutter with red, blue, yellow, and green borders.

<br><h4>ClearLook Policy</h4>

ClearLook comes with a prebuilt detection and replacement policy
that is used by default and that detects several misuse situations.
In the Launcher, you can specify a custom ClearLook policy 
by entering the policies' class name in the combo box.
This class must be in the class path to be used by ClearLook.
