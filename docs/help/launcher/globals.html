<H3>Global Options</H3>

The global options have been added by the JGoodies looks
to let you tweak the font sizes and button dimensions,
which in turn can lead to a better multi-platform appearance
and Windows emulation.

<br><h4>Font Size Hints</h4>

The font size hints help choosing better font sizes. 
In 1.3 environments these hints are used to guess 
an appropriate system font size for the current screen resolution.
In 1.4 environments, the size hints are used to 
modify the size of the menu and/or control font.


For details, see the <a href="../reference/fonts.html">reference</a>.



<br><h4>Button Margins</h4>

This option enables you to use narrow button margins, 
that better comply with native widget sets, especially 
the Windows widgetry.
You can either switch on this feature globally or
for individual buttons. 


For details, see the <a href="../reference/other.html">reference</a>.



<br><h4>Tab Icons</h4>

This features enables or disable icons in JTabbedPanes.


<br><h4>Plastic Tab Style</h4>

Enables you to choose a style for Plastic TabbedPanes,
the default flat Plastic style, vs. the Metal L&amp;F tab style.


<br><h4>Plastic Focus Contrast</h4>

Allows you to choose a focus color contrast style: low vs. high.
The low contrast focus colors look good, where the
high contrast focus colors are easier to perceive.


<br><h4>Screen Resolution Simulation (1.3 only)</h4>

In 1.3 environments, you can simulate a low screen resolution of 96 dpi,
or a higher screen resolution of 120 dpi. This will effect the font choice,
widget dimensions, insets, and several constants used by the JGoodies looks.
