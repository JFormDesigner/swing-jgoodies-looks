<H3>Menu Bar and Tool Bar</H3>

The JGoodies Looks provide optional settings 
that let you tweak the appearance of menu bars 
and tool bars. These options are intended for bars
that are located in an application's header.
They are switched off by default.

<p>For details, see the <a href="../reference/bars.html">reference</a>.


<br><h4>Header Style</h4>
You can tell the JGoodies looks, that a menu bar
or tool bar is in the header by setting the 
header style. The JGoodies looks will use this hint 
to choose look-specific special borders and 3D effects.
This is the recommended option.

<br><h4>Border Style</h4>
You can override the header style by setting a look-specific 
<i>border style</i>: empty, etched, or separator.

<br><h4>Plastic 3D Hint</h4>
Plastic chooses an appropriate default pseudo 3D effect
for the specified header and border style.
You can override the default by setting a Plastic 
3D hint.
