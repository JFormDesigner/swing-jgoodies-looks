<h3>Limitations</h3>


<h4>Paint Glitches When Switching from Non-JGoodies Looks</h4>

The JGoodies Looks can properly change of the look and theme at runtime.
<p>
Several other Look&Feel implementations prevent a proper change 
of the look and may cause paint problems after you've choosen
such a look in the Launcher.



<br><h4>Can't Simulate Resolution on 1.4 or Later</h4>

The screen resolution simulation modifies the 
JGoodies Looks good guess algorithm that is used 
in Java 1.3 environments, only.
Hence, this feature is disabled 1.4 environments.
