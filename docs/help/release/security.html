<h4>Digitally Signed Code</h4>

For data integrity and self-authentication the code has been 
digitally signed using a public-key certificate with the following owner: 
"CN=Karsten Lentzsch, OU=jGoodies.com, O=Karsten Lentzsch, L=Kiel, ST=Schleswig-Holstein, C=DE",
verified by the Thawte certification authority.

<p>
If you are using Java Web Start compatible technology to launch 
the application, the code will be automatically verified during startup. 
If you have a Java Development Kit (JDK), you can verify the 
code's data integrity, using the <tt>jarsigner</tt> tool.


<br><h4>No Internet Connection</h4>
The application does neither require nor establish an Internet connection.
Hence, auto generated error logs can't be sent automatically; 
they must be sent with your standard e-mail tool.
To help you send error log mail, the application provides 
a "Copy-to-Clipboard" mechanism that copies mail contents 
to the system clipboard.


<br><h4>Protected Privacy</h4>

If you experienced a runtime error the application will create
a <tt>console.log</tt> file. This file contains information
about the name, version, and hardware architecture of your
operating system. These information help me find bugs.
You can delete these information before sending the file.
