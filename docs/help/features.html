<H3>Features of the JGoodies Looks</H3>

<h4>Simplifying Multi Platform Support</h4>

The looks help you support different Java versions and operating systems.
Each look is consistent over the Java versions 1.3.x, 1.4.0x, and 1.4.1 
- to the possible extent w.r.t. to features of the underlying Swing API.

<p>
In addition, Plastic and the JGoodies Windows look use similiar
widget dimensions and widget font baselines to minimize layout 
differences between these looks.


<br><h4>High-Fidelity Windows Appearance</h4>

The JGoodies Windows look&amp;feel focuses on a precise emulation
of the Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000 flavors in the following areas: 
menus, icons, colors, borders, fonts, font sizes, insets, and widget dimensions.
Furthermore, it honors the screen resolution (96dpi vs. 120 dpi)
to adjust size constants, insets, and widget dimensions.

<p>
Although Plastic is a multi-platform look&amp;feel,
it works very well on all Windows platforms, including XP.
The Plastic color themes have been optimized for a harmonic
integration with the majority of desktops and 
won't alienate a Windows user.


<br><h4>ClearLook</h4>

The ClearLook technology is an add-on to the JGoodies looks 
and comes with the JGoodies Looks source code packages.
It can automatically correct the most critical and typical Swing misuse.
The idea behind ClearLook is to let an algorithm do 
what I have done repeatedly to polish Swing UIs.
Metamorphosis was the first step in this approach, where I tried to demonstrate
- step by step - how a Swing UI can benefit from a few simple modifications.
