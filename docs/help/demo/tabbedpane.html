<H3>Tabbed Pane Test</H3>

This page demonstrates optional settings for the tabbed pane content border
and tab style: you can choose to omit the content border, and you can 
set a flat tab style. 

<p>
These options help you reduce visual clutter in your user interface.
We recommend to suppress the content border, if the tabbed pane
is already wrapped by other borders, for example by a scroll pane 
or split pane border. 

<p>
The flat tabs further reduce the decorations used for the tabs
and so improve the UI's legibality - at least for frequent users. 
On the other hand, flat tabs may not be easily recognized 
as tabs by novice users.

<p>
You can set these optional settings by means of hints that you
specify via client properties of the JTabbedPane instance.
The JGoodies l&amp;fs honor these settings and omit the content border
or render the flat tabs - if the related client properties have been detected.
