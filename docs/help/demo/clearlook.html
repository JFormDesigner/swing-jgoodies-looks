<H3>ClearLook Test</H3>

This pages demos the effect of the JGoodies ClearLook add-on.
It consists of seven examples for obsolete borders and visual clutter.

<p>
If you switch on ClearLook in the Launcher, ClearLook will 
remove or replace borders and aims to improve the visual appearance.

You can quickly see what ClearLook considers as problematic,
if you switch on the <i>debug mode</i>.

<br><h4>Work in Progress</h4>

ClearLook is work in progress.
The desire for a timely rollout of the JGoodies looks update release 
constrained the amount of work that I could do. And so, several ClearLook 
improvements could not be incorporated in this version. 
<p>
The current DefaultClearLookPolicy doesn't detect two simple nested border contexts.
