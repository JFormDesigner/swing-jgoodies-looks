<H3>Menus</H3>

The JGoodies looks use an overhauled menu rendering system
for better readability, aesthetics, and an improved native 
emulation on Windows.

<p>
All menu items are aligned and use improved insets:
less for the icon, more white space for the label.
Radio and check box items don't duplicate the
default and custom icons. Menu separators use
more white space and can be narrow.
