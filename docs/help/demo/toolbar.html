<H3>Tool Bar</H3>

The tool bar can be tweaked to use look-specific 
special borders: empty, etched, separator
and can use a flat or light pseudo 3D effect.

<p>
You can either set a header style, or a 
look-specific border style. 
See the <a href="../reference/bars.html">reference</a> for details.

<br><h4>Corrected Rollover Borders</h4>

Both JGoodies looks use tool bar rollover borders
that enable you to properly switch the look at runtime.
If you have choosen a non-JGoodies look in the Launcher,
or have switched from such a look to a JGoodies look,
you may experience a broken rollover effect.
The toolbar buttons then have fixed borders 
or borders from a previously used look.


<br><h4>Look Hot Swap Test</h4>

To properly switch a look&amp;feel at runtime, look-specific
resources such as a border must implement the <tt>UIResource</tt> interface.
The button on the right side tests and shows if
all button border resources implement that interface.
Also, this button shall show a border, when the mouse is over.
