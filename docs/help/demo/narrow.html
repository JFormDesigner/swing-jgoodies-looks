<H3>Narrow Test</H3>

This page shows the effect of the JGoodies <i>narrow button</i> property,
how to save screen white space, and how different layout managers 
handle narrow buttons.

<p>
For an introduction, see 
the <a href="../launcher/globals.html">launcher settings</a>.
You can find background information in the 
<a href="../reference/other.html">reference</a>.

<p>
The page consists of three subpanels that use different layout managers,
and each subpanel contains the same three button rows.
The first row consists of buttons that have no narrow hint set.
These buttons will use the default wide margin unless you switch
on narrow buttons globally.
In the second row the button with <i>A Long Label</i> has
a narrow hint set. In the third row, all buttons are hinted
to be narrow.

<br><h4>BoxLayout</h4>

BoxLayout does not modify button widths, and so, 
shows the raw widths. You can see the smaller button widths
for narrow hinted buttons in the second and third line.

<br><h4>DesignGridLayout</h4>

The DesignGridLayout is used to equalize the width of the first four buttons
and doesn't modify the width of the last button.
This leads to a good layout compromise for the first and second button rows.

<br><h4>GridLayout</h4>

The GridLayout equalizes all button widths. In this case,
a single narrow hint can significantly reduce the space
consumed by the button row.
