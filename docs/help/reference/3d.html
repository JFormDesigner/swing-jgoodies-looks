<H3>3D Effects and 3D Hints</H3>

You can enable or disable the pseudo 3D effect in 
the JGoodies Plastic and Plastic3D looks
for a widget type and for individual widgets:

<pre>
   UIManager.put("ScrollBar.is3DEnabled", Boolean.FALSE);
   
   JButton button = new JButton("Flat");
   button.putClientProperty("is3DEnabled", Boolean.FALSE);
</pre>

<p>
The Plastic3D look differs from the Plastic look
in that it enables the 3D effects per default for all widgets.
However, some Plastic themes, override this default,
for example, to use flat scroll bars.

<p>
In some conditions Plastic will refuse to use a 3D effect,
for example, if a JButton paints no border.
