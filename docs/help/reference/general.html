<H3>General Implementation and API Remarks</H3>

The implementations of the JGoodies looks have been
optimized for:
<ul>
<li>a small library size, 
<li>compliance with the Swing API,
<li>consistent look for all version of the J2SE since 1.3,
<li>precise layout,
<li>high-fidelity Windows emulation,
<li>simple API.
</ul>


<h4>Swing Compliance</h4>

The JGoodies looks are compliant with the Swing API
and honor all Swing settings in the same way as
the Sun look and feel implementations do.


<br><h4>Global vs. Look-Specific Settings</h4>

The JGoodies Windows L&amp;F and the JGoodies Plastic L&amp;F
introduce and share several optional settings. You can find
all global options in class <tt>com.jgoodies.plaf.Options</tt>,
and look-specific settings in the particular LookAndFeel
subclasses: <tt>ExtWindowsLookAndFeel</tt>, <tt>PlasticLookAndFeel</tt>, 
and <tt>Plastic3DLookAndFeel</tt>.


<br><h4>UIManager vs. JGoodies Classes</h4>

You can either specify JGoodies options via the <tt>UIManager</tt> class
or via JGoodies classes, most noticably the <tt>Options</tt> class.
<p>
You can put values for specific keys in the UIManager.
This decouples your application code from the JGoodies implementations,
and so avoids the need to import JGoodies classes in your code. 
This is the recommended way, if you cannot (easily) modify your code, 
or if you are not allowed to import third party libraries.
<p>
Calling the JGoodies methods enables static compiler checks
and will be the preferred way to set options, if you have
full control over your application code.
