<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 What does the JGoodies Looks Demo do?</font>
<DD>This demo lets you test drive the JGoodies Windows L&amp;F and 
the JGoodies Plastic L&amp;F. You can choose settings and define options in the launcher
and see and check the effect in the demo frame.
<p>
Also, the accompanying sources help licensees to understand 
options that have been introduced by the JGoodies Looks.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 Can I help you?</font>
<DD>Purchasing the JGoodies Looks professional source code packages 
helps me finance the future development of advanced Java client technology.

<P>
<DT><b><a name="2">&nbsp;</a>2 Java and Swing Questions</b>

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.1"></a>2.1 Can I get the source code?</font>
<DD>I provide a professional code package that contains the sources 
for the JGoodies Looks. Check the Looks section at www.JGoodies.com
for more information about this package.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Can I get the source code for free?</font>
<DD>I wholeheartly like to help you, and more generally the Java community,
to write Java client applications that look good and work well. 
And I believe that reading my sources, and using my framework and looks 
can significantly improve your Java GUI and speed up the development process.
<p><br>
I'd like to use my skills and capabilities, and work for the community, fulltime. 
And I'm looking for a way how to finance my efforts, where my favorite is
to be hired by a major Java promoter, for example, Sun. 
But until now, I have found no other solution than selling code,
and so, unfortunately, only a minority of IT professionals will 
benefit from my source code.
<p><br>
That said, I'd like to add, that I offer the sources at no charge
to individuals and organizations that have significantly helped 
the Java community. If you believe that you are qualified, 
contact me at karsten@jgoodies.com.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.3"></a>2.3 What about opening the sources?</font>
<DD>Many people have asked me to open my source code, so that others
can learn from it. Also, my tools, the underlying framework, and looks would benefit
from feedback and would get a higher quality w.r.t. readability, stability,
multi-platform support, and new features.
<p><br>
From <i>my</i> perspective there are also good reasons to not open the sources.
For example, I fear to loose ground against competitors in the areas of 
user interface consulting and as GUI code provider, which is my financial basis.
<p><br>
Nevertheless, if you believe, that I would benefit from opening the sources -
more than I would loose - I encourage you to speak up and tell me why.
You can find more information about this issue in the above answers, 
and in the Inside section at www.jgoodies.com.
<p><br>
Anyway, I will immediately <i>open</i> the complete source code 
if I cannot maintain it in a good quality.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.4"></a>2.4 Can I get the look&amp;feel used in this demo?</font>
<DD>I provide a professional source code package that contains
the JGoodies Plastic and JGoodies Windows look &amp; feel;
it comes with support and more sample code.
<p><br>
Probably, I'll provide a binary code edition for non-commercial use 
at no charge and without support, later this year.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.5"></a>2.5 What icon set do you use?</font>
<DD>I have copied or derived most icons from the eclipse project, see www.eclipse.org.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.6"></a>2.6 Can you recommend a Swing tutorial or book?</font>
<DD>There are several tutorials and books that can help you get started with
the Swing widget toolkit, widgets, and basic configuration. 
The Swing book by Robinson and Vorobiev is one of the better books.
<p><br>
I haven't found a tutorial or book that helps you build effective 
Swing applications, i.e. that look good and work well. And I'd like
to fill this gap, see the Inside section at www.jgoodies.com.

<br>
<DT><FONT class="question"><a name="2.7"></a>2.7 How can I make my application look like yours?</font>
<DD>If you'd like to quickly improve your application's appearance, and usability,
I recommend to check my Swing short course <i>Metamorphosis</i>, see
www.jgoodies.com/metamorphosis/. And you may consider to license the JGoodies looks
and framework.
<p><br>
If you either need an introduction or reference about do's and don'ts in 
GUI design, read Jeff Johnson's <i>GUI Bloopers</i>. 
If you are busy and can't find the time to read 500 pages, just look at 
the book's contents and check whether you have an idea what all the topics are about.
In this case, I guess, a medium skilled GUI designer will read about 50 pages.
<p><br>
A thin book and recommended reading is <i>Designing Visual Interfaces</i> by Mullet &amp; Sano.
If you read 100 pages of this book, you will learn the most valuable
basics of user interface design, and more generally, design.
It is useful for the daily work of every GUI developer.
