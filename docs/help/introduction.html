<H3>An Introduction to the JGoodies Looks Demo</H3>

     The JGoodies Looks Demo utilizes, presents, and tests the 
     JGoodies Windows Look&Feel and the JGoodies Plastic Look&Feel. 
     
     <p>
     The demo consists of two parts: in the launcher you can select
     the look, color theme, and define options provided by the looks;
     a sample application then shows the effect of the current settings.
