                   JGoodies Tiny Version 1.0


The JGoodies Tiny application is a minimal Swing application 
that demos how to install and use a JGoodies look&feel.
     
Tiny requires the JGoodies looks libraries. Go to Tiny directory; 
if you have the looks libraries in your classpath you can use:
    java Tiny
         
If you don't have the looks libraries in your classpath use:
    java -cp .;<looks-install-dir>/lib/looks-all.jar Tiny
