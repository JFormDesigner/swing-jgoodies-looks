                       Version 2.0 Snapshot
                          Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This is a stable pre-RC build for the JGoodies Looks 2.0.
    The major changes are better support for Windows Vista,
    Java 5 and 6, and an overhauled font lookup in all L&fs.
    
    The font lookup in the Windows L&f has been overhauled.
    Text component insets have been adjusted to better comply 
    with the Microsoft Layout Specification and Guidelines.
    Also, Windows Vista is now supported; bounds, insets and 
    font baseline positions are consistent on the Vista betas.
    
    The Plastic L&f family component bounds and insets 
    have been adjusted to the new Windows bounds and insets.
    The Plastic font lookup has been completely overhauled; 
    the current implementation is fine on Windows and works
    well on other platforms. A new font customization mechanism
    allows you to change the fonts per L&f, platform, locale 
    and desktop settings.
    
    THE HTML DOCUMENTATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CODE.  
    The docs will be updated for the 2.0 release candidate.
    
    Although this is a beta, the contained Windows L&f
    and Plastic L&fs supercede all previous version w.r.t.
    consistency, micro design precision, and support
    for new Java runtimes and Windows editions.
    
    The beta state shall indicate that the user community
    can still change the new font lookup mechnism before
    the 2.0 final is released. So speak up now if you need 
    API changes or implementation changes.
    
    
HELP REQUIRED FROM USERS WITH NON-WESTERN WINDOWS

    The Looks 2.0 shall better support non-western environments.
    Especially it shall be able to display Chinese, Japanese,
    Korean and other non-western languages easily (Issue #10).
    This should work on non-Windows platforms, because the Looks 
    then use the logical fonts defined by the Java runtime. 
    And it may work on non-western Windows too; but I'd like 
    to verify the latter before publishing the 2.0 final.
    
    Therefore I'd like to get feedback from users that run 
    a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or other non-Western Windows XP
    or Windows Vista with Java 1.4.2, Java 5 or Java 6.
    This Beta ships with a FontTest tool ("fonttest.jar") that 
    displays detailed information about the Java environment,
    platform, and font settings. I should appreciate if some users 
    of non-western Windows could run the tool, copy the information 
    to the clipboard and send it to dev@looks.dev.java.net.
    
	
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    All font options have been removed from the Windows L&f;
    it shall be as close to the native original as possible.

    o Replaced Options.CONTROL_FONT_KEY and MENU_FONT_KEY by:
      - PLASTIC_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - PLASTIC_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - PLASTIC_MENU_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - WINDOWS_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_MENU_FONT_KEY    
    o Removed Options.EXT_WINDOWS_NAME
    o Removed Options.FONT_SIZE_HINTS_KEY
    o Removed Options#getGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed Options#setGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed FontSizeHints
    o Removed LookUtils#createButtonMargin(boolean)
    o Removed LookUtils#installNarrowMargin
    o Removed FontUtils
    o Options#initializeDefaultReplacements now private
    o Removed obsolete Plastic themes: SkyBluerTahoma, 
      ExperienceBlueDefaultFont, DesertBluerDefautFont
      
    The FontSizeHints have been replaced by the FontPolicy mechanism.
      
      
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE VISUAL COMPATIBILITY

    Options#getUseNarrowButtons returns true by default.
    Although the narrow margins are the correct button margins,
    it leads to poor design if you don't ensure a reasonable
    minimum width for buttons with a short text, e.g. "OK".
    You can disable this feature using #setUseNarrowButtons(false),
    which was the behavior in the JGoodies Looks 1.x.
    
    Options.DEFAULT_LOOK_NAME is now PLASTICXP_NAME
    making PlasticXP the default L&f when chosen via
    the Options L&f names. PLASTICXP_NAME is also returned
    by Options#getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName.
      
    On Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/2003/XP the JGoodies Windows L&f 
    follows the "Microsoft Layout Specifications and Guidelines" 
    even closer than the JGoodies Windows L&f version 1.3.
    Components that are arranged in a row have perceived bounds 
    of 14 dialog units (dlu). Since Windows XP command buttons
    (in the default styles) have two transparent lines in 
    the top and bottom, the concrete command button bounds
    are 2 pixels larger than for the textfield, combo, etc.
    If you lay out them in a row and center them vertically 
    the perceived (aka visual) bounds will be aligned.
       On Windows Vista the JGoodies Windows L&f dimensions
    and insets are based on the "Windows Vista UX Guidelines" 
    version 0.8. The JGoodies sizes differ slightly from
    the sizes recommended by these guidelines. For example
    the guidelines recommend to make a text field on 96dpi
    with normal fonts 20px tall, a combo 21px and buttons 22px
    (or 13dlu). The JGoodies Windows L&f uses consistent sizes, 
    insets and font baseline positions for all components
    that are arranged in a row - just as recommended in all 
    previous Windows editions, but based on 13dlu because 
    the new default font Segoe UI is significantly taller.
    
    Also, the default font chosen on Windows now honors
    the desktop font setting (Normal/Large/Extra Large).
    Although Microsoft recommends to use the font size
    to get larger fonts, many applications ignore it
    and just scale with the software resolution (96dpi/120dpi).
       On 96dpi the new font doesn't differ from the 
    font chosen by the Looks 1.x; it's Tahoma 8pt on modern
    Windows, and Segoe UI 9pt on Vista. However, on 120dpi
    the new font is 1px taller than the font used by the
    Looks 1.x. 
    
    The Plastic L&f family uses Windows fonts on Windows
    and logical fonts on all other platforms. In the Looks 1.x
    most Plastic themes used the Tahoma font on all platforms.
    If Tahoma was absent, the logical fonts were used.

      
VISUAL BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

    It is recommended to use the new default settings and 
    it is strongly recommended to use the new font lookup
    on Windows. However, here's how you can get the appearance
    of the Looks 1.x. These configurations listed below
    must be performed before you install a look&feel.
    
    To get the wrong wide button margins, call:
      Options.setNarrowMargins(false).
      
    To use the Looks 1.x fonts in the Windows L&f use:
      WindowsLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getLooks1xWindowsPolicy());
          
    To use the Looks 1.x fonts in the Plastic L&fs use:
      PlasticLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getLooks1xPlasticPolicy());
          
    To give Plastic the new fonts on Windows and the
    Looks 1.x fonts on other platforms use:
      PlasticLookAndFeel.setFontPolicy(
          FontPolicies.getTransitionalPlasticPolicy());
          
    You can customize the control font and menu font
    in the system properties for Windows and Plastic:
    java -jar -DWindows.controlFont="Tahoma-plain-11"
              -DWindows.menuFont="Tahoma-plain-12"
              -DPlastic.controlFont="Tahoma-plain-11"
              -DPlastic.menuFont="Verdana-bold-12"
        myapplication.jar
    If the menu font is not specified, the control font
    will be used for menus too.


BUGS FIXED

    #51:  Windows combobox with custom render is too narrow.
    #60:  Wrong combobox height in Java 5 and Java 6.
    #67:  Wrong menu border in Windows XP L&f.
    #69:  Broken menu item anti-aliasing in Java 5 or later.
    #70:  Inconsistent bounds, insets and baselines on Windows Vista.

KNOWN ISSUES

    Plastic 3D effect broken on Mac OS X Tiger with Java 1.4 and 5.
    Due to a bug in the Tiger Java2D implementation, the pseudo 3D
    up and down effects are not rendered. Instead a plain white
    is painted. See also issue #92.
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    #55: Add option to make combo popups wider than the combo.
         You can set a popup prototype display value that
         is used to determine with popup widths.
         
    o Narrow buttons can be disabled in the system properties.
    o Added a JPopupMenu client property for no-margin borders,
      see Options#NO_MARGIN_KEY. This is useful if a JPopupMenu 
      contains a single component, for example a JScrollPane.
    o Added a JTextArea client property for an info background.
      This hint is used for non-editable areas that shall use
      the editable background, not the inactive background.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Merged the source folders 'src/common', 'src/plastic'
      and 'src/windows' to 'src/core'.
    o The sources no longer ship as a source Zip archive.
      They now come in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
      This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
      If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
      point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o The Windows and Plastic L&fs have been tweaked for Windows Vista.
    o Overhauled the Windows combobox layout and rendering.
    o Overhauled the Plastic combobox layout and rendering.
    o Improved appearance of the Looks demo tabs on Windows.
    o The demo's DemoFrame class accepts a parameter for the L&f: 
      "Windows", "Plastic", "Plastic3D", "PlasticXP",
      or a full class name like:
      "com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel",
      "javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel".

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a bug and cleans up some code.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o I have discontinued to ship the plastic-xxx.jar and looks-win-xxx.jar
      that contain only the classes for Plastic and ExtWindows respectively.
      These jars were optional and seemed to confuse several developers;
      I've seen installations where all three jars were in the classpath.
      The ANT build script still generates all three jar files. 
      It's just that since 1.2.2 I ship only the looks-xxx.jar.
