                    JGoodies Looks, Version 1.2.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a bug and cleans up some code.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o I have discontinued to ship the plastic-xxx.jar and looks-win-xxx.jar
      that contain only the classes for Plastic and ExtWindows respectively.
      These jars were optional and seemed to confuse several developers;
      I've seen installations where all three jars were in the classpath.
      The ANT build script still generates all three jar files. 
      It's just that since 1.2.2 I ship only the looks-xxx.jar.
      

BUGS FIXED

    o Wide toolbar rollover button margins if no margin has been set.   
    

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Renamed LookUtils#isLowRes to #IS_LOW_RESOLUTION.


KNOWN ISSUES

    For all issues see http://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues

    This release still lacks an improved font management
    for the Plastic l&f family on non-Windows platforms.
    For a workaround see issue #10.
      

OTHER CHANGES

    o Docs:      Added FAQ entry regarding the use of the extension path
    o Docs:      Refreshed the JavaDocs and HTML docs for font size hints.
    o Demo:      Improved file headers and JavaDocs; removed unused code.

    used for an automatic look&feel detection.
