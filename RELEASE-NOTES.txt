               JGoodies Looks, Version 2.0 Preview 2 
                          Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This is a stable preview for the JGoodies Looks 2.0.
    The major changes are better support for Windows Vista,
    Java 6, and an overhauled font lookup in all L&fs.
    
    NOTE: THE CODE IS MORE "RAW" THAN OTHER RELEASES THAT 
    YOU MAY HAVE DOWNLOADED FROM JGOODIES IN THE PAST!
    It is an engineering build that may contain known bugs 
    in some areas. 
        
    The font lookup in the Windows L&f has been overhauled.
    Text component insets have been adjusted to better comply 
    with the Microsoft Layout Specification and Guidelines.
    Also, Windows Vista is now supported; bounds, insets and 
    font baseline positions are consistent on the Vista betas.
    
    The text component insets of the Plastic L&f family
    have been adjusted to the new Windows L&f dimensions.
    The Plastic font lookup has been completely overhauled; 
    the current implementation is fine on Windows but needs 
    improvements on other platforms. 
    
    THE DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED.  
    
	
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE BINARY COMPATIBILITY

    All font options have been removed from the Windows L&f;
    it shall be as close to the native original as possible.

    o Replace Options.CONTROL_FONT_KEY and MENU_FONT_KEY by:
      - PLASTIC_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - PLASTIC_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - PLASTIC_MENU_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_FONT_CHOICE_POLICY_KEY
      - WINDOWS_CONTROL_FONT_KEY    
      - WINDOWS_MENU_FONT_KEY    
    o Removed Options.EXT_WINDOWS_NAME
    o Removed Options.FONT_SIZE_HINTS_KEY
    o Removed Options#getGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed Options#setGlobalFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed PlasticLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#getFontSizeHints
    o Removed WindowsLookAndFeel#setFontSizeHints
    o Removed FontSizeHints
    o Removed LookUtils#createButtonMargin(boolean)
    o Removed LookUtils#installNarrowMargin
    o Removed WindowsButtonUI
    o Removed WindowsToggleButtonUI
    o Removed FontUtils
    o Options#initializeDefaultReplacements now private
    o Removed obsolete Plastic themes: SkyBluerTahoma, 
      ExperienceBlueDefaultFont, DesertBluerDefautFont
      
      
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE VISUAL COMPATIBILITY

    Basically, the Windows L&f now follows the "Microsoft
    Layout Specifications and Guidelines" even closer than
    the JGoodies Windows L&f in the JGoodies Looks 1.3.
    Components that are arranged in a row have perceived bounds 
    of 14 dialog units (dlu). Since Windows XP command buttons
    (in the default styles) have two transparent lines in 
    the top and bottom, the concrete command button bounds
    are 2 pixels larger than for the textfield, combo, etc.
    If you lay out them in a row and center them vertically 
    the perceived (aka visual) bounds will be aligned.

    o Options#getUseNarrowButtons returns true by default.
      You can disable this feature using #setUseNarrowButtons(false).
    o Options.DEFAULT_LOOK_NAME is now PLASTICXP_NAME.
    o Options.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName returns
      the PLASTICXP_NAME.


BUGS FIXED

    #50: ToolBar 3D effect ignores the orientation.
    #51: Windows combobox with custom render is too narrow.
    #60: Wrong combobox height in Java 5 and Java 6.
    #67: Wrong menu border in Windows XP L&f.
    #69: Broken menu item anti-aliasing in Java 5 or later.
    #70: Inconsistent bounds, insets and baselines on Windows Vista.
    #71: Password echo character too small on Windows Vista.
    #73: Windows L&f ignores the desktop control font size setting.
    #79: Windows combobox too narrow.
    #80: Plastic combo arrow button is focusable in Java 6.
    #81: Wrong icon for "OptionPane.questionIcon" property.
    #83: Windows tabbed pane has line under selected tab
         in Java 5 or later if the content border is disabled.
    #84: Windows L&F combo margin too wide in table.
    #86: Windows combobox too narrow if the renderer has zero insets.
    #90: Spinner does not stop the timer when loosing focus.
    #91: Progress invisible in Plastic Silver theme.
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    #55: Add option to make combo popups wider than the combo.
    o Narrow buttons can be disabled in the system properties.
    o Added a JPopupMenu client property for no-margin borders,
      see Options#NO_MARGIN_KEY. This is useful if a JPopupMenu 
      contains a single component, for example a JScrollPane.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Merged the source folders 'src/common', 'src/plastic'
      and 'src/windows' to 'src/core'.
    o The sources no longer ship as a source Zip archive.
      They now come in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
      This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
      If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
      point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o The Windows and Plastic L&fs have been tweaked for Windows Vista.
    o Overhauled the Windows combobox layout and rendering.
    o Improved appearance of the Looks demo tabs on Windows.
    o Password field antialiasing honors the field's aa hint
      and uses subpixel aa if available.
    o The demo's DemoFrame class accepts a parameter for the L&f: 
      "Windows", "Plastic", "Plastic3D", "PlasticXP".

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a bug and cleans up some code.


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o I have discontinued to ship the plastic-xxx.jar and looks-win-xxx.jar
      that contain only the classes for Plastic and ExtWindows respectively.
      These jars were optional and seemed to confuse several developers;
      I've seen installations where all three jars were in the classpath.
      The ANT build script still generates all three jar files. 
      It's just that since 1.2.2 I ship only the looks-xxx.jar.
      

BUGS FIXED

    o Wide toolbar rollover button margins if no margin has been set.   
    

CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Renamed LookUtils#isLowRes to #IS_LOW_RESOLUTION.


KNOWN ISSUES

    For all issues see http://looks.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues

    This release still lacks an improved font management
    for the Plastic l&f family on non-Windows platforms.
    For a workaround see issue #10.
      

OTHER CHANGES

    o Docs:      Added FAQ entry regarding the use of the extension path
    o Docs:      Refreshed the JavaDocs and HTML docs for font size hints.
    o Demo:      Improved file headers and JavaDocs; removed unused code.

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance update is primarily a code and documentation cleanup.

    therefore this release is binary and visually compatible with 1.1.2.
    Pending code and visual issues will be addressed by the next version.

    used for an automatic look&feel detection. 


DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Added service descriptors to all library JARs

    o Fixed broken classpath in demo jars
